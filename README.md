# Cleaner-Tracker
The cleaning app that gets you. ADHD-friendly task tracker with satisfying checkboxes, a laundry timer (because we all forget), and a ‘I’m struggling’ mode for those days. No judgment, just progress. Your house won’t clean itself, but at least now you’ll remember what needs doing.
